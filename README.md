# 21 Savage Site - Server Side

This project is a simple CRUD app and it is modeled after a simple social media site. A user can write a message which will then be uploaded to the messages section of the page. Then other users can choose to like or dislike a message and the number of likes or dislikes will increase or decrease accordingly. Any message can be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned 

I'm getting more familiar using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, but it was definitely a challenge trying to connect my own database to this project at first. I am excited to learn new ways I can make updates to make the site more creative.
